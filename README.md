# ttrss-opencc
Conversion between Traditional and Simplified Chinese via OpenCC for ttrss

This plugin is still WIP:

1. I'm still solving the issue [#1](https://github.com/HenryQW/ttrss_opencc/issues/1) , so that it can run locally with your ttrss https://github.com/HenryQW/docker-ttrss-plugins
1. I'm still testing its stability under this API server mode, before I deploy a free instance for everyone.
